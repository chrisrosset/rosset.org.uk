title: About
---

My name is Christopher Rosset and I am a programming enthusiast with an interest in Finance.

I work as a Financial Software Developer at Bloomberg L.P. in London.

I am a Computer Science graduate of KCL and the University of Oxford.
At the moment, I am also pursuing a part-time degree in Mathematics at the Open University.


## LinkedIn

Perhaps unsurprisingly, I have a [LinkedIn account](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/christopher-rosset/47/2a1/b09/) with detailed information about my education and work experience.

## GitHub

I also have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/chrisrosset) which I probably should use more.
