title: About
---

My name is Christopher Rosset and I am a programming enthusiast with an
interest in Finance who is currently pursuing an MSc in Computer
Science at the [University Of Oxford](http://ox.ac.uk).

## LinkedIn

Perhaps unsurprisingly, I have a [LinkedIn
account](http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/christopher-rosset/47/2a1/b09/) with some
more information about my education and work experience.

## GitHub

I also have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/chrisrosset) which I probably
should use more.

## CV

Apart from the LinkedIn account, I also maintan a regular CV which you can
download from [this link]().
